# Evidence: 1 Implementation of Lexical Analysis

## Description
The language that I chose is the elven language (also called Quenya) which according to Wikipedia (2024) "is a constructed language, one of those devised by J. R. R. Tolkien for the Elves in his Middle-earth fiction." Tolkien based the language on Finnish, Latin, and Old English.

The words that I chose to model are specifically these 5 words: 
1. Tengwa - Quenya word for 'Letter', plural form "Tengwar" means 'Letters'.
2. Tinco - metal
3. Tuilë - Quenya word for "spring"
4. Thalias - Bravery
5. Thalin - Dauntless

I decided to use a *DFA* since my endgame is to only accept these five words as valid and no others, and it is quite easier to implement and ensure that no other words are accepted.

## Models
I only decided to generate one automaton for this language, since there is no need to generate another with the following solution. It is important to mention that the automaton is only valid for the following alphabet: 

$\sum{}
